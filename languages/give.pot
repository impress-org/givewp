It's also the only PHP version still in active development and therefore the better option for your site in the long run."

The \"Modal\" display mode opens the credit card fieldset within a popup window. The \"Reveal\" mode will slide into place the additional fields. If you're looking for a simple button, then \"Button\" more is the way to go. This allows you to create a customizable \"Donate Now\" button which will open the donation form upon clicking. There's tons of possibilities here, give it a try!"
