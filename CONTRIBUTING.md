## Security Considerations

* When integrating with payment gateways make sure that all data relevent to the gateway is going directly to the gateway an nowhere else, especially credit card data
* Under no circumstances should the payment method details (i.e. credit card deatails) be stored on the server

## Code Documentation

* We ensure that every GiveWP function is documented well and follows the standards set by phpDoc
* If you're adding/editing a function in a class, make sure to add `@access {private|public|protected}`
* Finally, please use tabs and not spaces. The tab indent size should be 4 for all GiveWP code.

That's all! You're done.

## How to test code before creating PR
You can create an awesome PR if:
1. `/wp-content/debug.log` is empty after testing code functionality.
2. Does not contain and testing code like `var_dump()` and `console.log()`.
3. Passes all phpunit tests.
4. No formatting issue when check formatting via `php_codesniffer`/`eslint` with `WordPress Coding Standard`.
5. Works fine on at least on PHP `5.3` and PHP `7.*`
6. Plugin loads fine with your code on PHP `5.2`
