/**
 * Class Facade
 *
 * This class provides a way of taking a normal instance class and creating a static facade out of it. It does it in
 * such a way, though, that the facade is still mockable. It does this by instantiating the decorated class through the
 * Give Service Container (SC). So by injecting a mock singleton of the decorated class in the SC, it can be mocked.
 *
 * To use this, simply make a new facade class which extends this once, then implement the getFacadeClass and return the
 * class to be decorated, for example: return MyClass::class;
 *
 * To help the IDE, take the methods from the decorated class and add them your class docblock. So if Repository had an
 * insert method, you would add "@method static Model insert()" to the top.
