=== ✨ GiveWP Features ===

GiveWP is free and full of many advanced features to suit your needs. Start by choosing one of our donation form templates to create your first fundraising campaign. Then, take advantage of full-featured fundraising reports and donor management tools to increase your overall fundraising revenue by learning what makes donors donate.

Free donor tools also help keep your donors happy. The donor dashboard helps your donor base easily manage their accounts and access their donation history. With our [premium add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons "See all our Premium Add-ons"), you can add additional donor tools, like annual receipts.

**[Campaign-Based Fundraising and Forms](https://docs.givewp.com/campaigns-release-readme "See how powerful our fundraising campaigns and forms can be")**

GiveWP makes it easy to manage and launch successful fundraising campaigns directly from your WordPress site. Whether you’re raising funds for a single project, a long-term cause, or a series of initiatives, GiveWP's campaign-based approach helps you streamline your efforts and maximize your fundraising potential.

#### **Key Features of Campaign-Based Fundraising**

* **Campaign Creation:** Create multiple campaigns on your site, each with its own unique donation goal, target audience, and messaging.
* **Customizable Donation Forms:** Each campaign comes with a built-in, fully customizable landing page, created using the WordPress Block Editor. Add text, images, and donation forms to create a visually appealing and engaging page that strengthens your donor connections.
* **Dedicated Landing Pages:** Create custom landing pages for each campaign, complete with campaign-specific content, donation forms, progress bars, and social sharing options to engage and inspire donors.
* **Organized Fundraising**: All your donation forms are linked to specific campaigns. This makes it easy to manage and track your efforts, set goals, and monitor campaign performance in one streamlined view.
* **Visibility Controls**: Publish, archive, or draft campaigns to manage when and how your campaigns appear on your site. This gives you full control over the visibility of your campaigns and associated donation forms.

#### **How Campaigns and Donation Forms Work Together**

GiveWP's donation forms seamlessly integrate with your campaigns, allowing you to:

* Create forms that directly support the campaign's fundraising goals.
* Customize form fields to match the needs of your campaign, whether it's a specific project or a general cause.
* Promote campaigns via donation forms displayed on any page on your website.

Campaigns offer more flexibility, better control, and enhanced organization for your fundraising efforts, making it easier to achieve your goals and connect with donors. Whether you're running a large-scale initiative or multiple smaller projects, Campaigns will help you streamline the process and improve your overall fundraising strategy.

=== 💝 Simple and Pain-Free Giving ===

We built GiveWP to be the best WordPress donation plugin from day one. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started.

The strength of GiveWP lies within its optimized donation forms. When creating a form, you can start with a template and customize the donation levels, including allowing donors to give a custom amount. The donation forms can then be displayed anywhere on your website using a block, shortcode, widget, or the single donation form page.
You can also integrate your forms with a wide variety of payment processors, including PayPal and Stripe within the free plugin. You can also purchase add-ons to use Authorize,net, Bitpay, Square, and more.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 6.6 or greater
* PHP version 7.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.7 or greater
* MariaDB version 10 or later
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* cURL version 5.40 or higher
* An SSL certificate -- while this is not strictly required, it is highly recommend. If you are converting your site to use SSL/HTTPS now, [we have a detailed guide to help you here](https://go.givewp.com/ssl).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of GiveWP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "GiveWP" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I learn more about how to use GiveWP? =

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring GiveWP [on our website](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs). We suggest starting with the [GiveWP 101 article](https://go.givewp.com/give-101).

= How can I get support for GiveWP? =

We work hard to the best support possible for GiveWP. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.

[Priority support](https://go.givewp.com/support) is given to users who have an active license for one of GiveWP's [Add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons) or [Pricing Plans](https://go.givewp.com/pricing). We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average 1st response time of 2 to 4 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.

= Do you have any demos? =

Yes! We have several live examples of GiveWP and the wide variety of form options you can use with GiveWP. Check out our [live demo](https://go.givewp.com/demosite), where you can see what your donors would see.

GiveWP Plus, Pro, and Agency Plan customers will also get a free 30-minute website audit with our Customer Success Team after they purchase. In this meeting, we’ll cover everything you need to know about GiveWP to fit your needs.

= Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using GiveWP? =

Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.
"GiveWP Stories" are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented GiveWP with success. [You can read them all here](https://go.givewp.com/stories).
"Case Studies" are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented GiveWP for a specific purpose for an organization. [You can read those here](https://go.givewp.com/case-studies).

= How is GiveWP better than a simple PayPal donate button? =

PayPal donate buttons take your users off-site, which can cause you to lose some in the process. With GiveWP, your donors can stay on-site and you get the benefit of gathering donor data, viewing free fundraising reports, and creating unlimited donation forms. On the other hand, you can always use GiveWP as a simple customized PayPal donate button if you prefer.

= How is GiveWP better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress? =

Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like GiveWP has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a "Donate Now!" button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you'll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins -- but not with GiveWP.

GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They'll work great alongside each other.

= How is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type in their information. You, as the site admin, don’t want to have to change the word “Products” to “Donations” everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping, either.

On top of that, customizing the plugin’s terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an “invoice” for the donation “product” they “purchased.” Rather, you’d like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.

Use GiveWP for donations, and let your WooCommerce or WP eCommerce plugin or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.

Additionally, you can use our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce](https://go.givewp.com/addon-upsells/) GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout.

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/give)
