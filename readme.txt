=== üíù Simple and Pain-Free Giving ===

We built GiveWP to be the best WordPress donation plugin from day one. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started.

The strength of GiveWP lies within its optimized donation forms. When creating a form, you can start with a template and customize the donation levels, including allowing donors to give a custom amount. The donation forms can then be displayed anywhere on your website using a block, shortcode, widget, or the single donation form page.
You can also integrate your forms with a wide variety of payment processors, including PayPal and Stripe within the free plugin. You can also purchase add-ons to use Authorize,net, Bitpay, Square, and more.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.9 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater
* MariaDB version 10 or later
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* cURL version 5.40 or higher
* An SSL certificate -- while this is not strictly required, it is highly recommend. If you are converting your site to use SSL/HTTPS now, [we have a detailed guide to help you here](https://go.givewp.com/ssl).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of GiveWP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "GiveWP" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I learn more about how to use GiveWP? =

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring GiveWP [on our website](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs). We suggest starting with the [GiveWP 101 article](https://go.givewp.com/give-101).

= How can I get support for GiveWP? =

We work hard to the best support possible for GiveWP. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.

[Priority support](https://go.givewp.com/support) is given to users who have an active license for one of GiveWP's [Add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons) or [Pricing Plans](https://go.givewp.com/pricing). We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average 1st response time of 2 to 4 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.

= Do you have any demos? =

Yes! We have several live examples of GiveWP and the wide variety of form options you can use with GiveWP. Check out our [live demo](https://go.givewp.com/demosite), where you can see what your donors would see. 

GiveWP Plus, Pro, and Agency Plan customers will also get a free 30-minute website audit with our Customer Success Team after they purchase. In this meeting, we‚Äôll cover everything you need to know about GiveWP to fit your needs.

= Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using GiveWP? =

Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.
"GiveWP Stories" are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented GiveWP with success. [You can read them all here](https://go.givewp.com/stories).
"Case Studies" are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented GiveWP for a specific purpose for an organization. [You can read those here](https://go.givewp.com/case-studies).

= How is GiveWP better than a simple PayPal donate button? =

PayPal donate buttons take your users off-site, which can cause you to lose some in the process. With GiveWP, your donors can stay on-site and you get the benefit of gathering donor data, viewing free fundraising reports, and creating unlimited donation forms. On the other hand, you can always use GiveWP as a simple customized PayPal donate button if you prefer. 

= How is GiveWP better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress? =

Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like GiveWP has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a "Donate Now!" button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you'll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins -- but not with GiveWP.

GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They'll work great alongside each other.

= How is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type in their information. You, as the site admin, don‚Äôt want to have to change the word ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù to ‚ÄúDonations‚Äù everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping, either.

On top of that, customizing the plugin‚Äôs terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an ‚Äúinvoice‚Äù for the donation ‚Äúproduct‚Äù they ‚Äúpurchased.‚Äù Rather, you‚Äôd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.

Use GiveWP for donations, and let your WooCommerce or WP eCommerce plugin or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.

Additionally, you can use our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce](https://go.givewp.com/addon-upsells/) GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout.

= How do I eliminated the 2% fee on Stripe donations? =

The 2% fee on Stripe donations only applies to donations taken via our free Stripe integration in GiveWP Core. If you purchase the premium Stripe add-on you will not have any additional fees at all. Additionally, even with the free Stripe plugin, the fees only apply to one-time donations, never to recurring donations.

[Read our release announcement](https://go.givewp.com/version2-5) for all the details, and if you have further questions feel free to reach out via [our contact page](https://go.givewp.com/contact).

[#4255](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/pull/4255)

= 2.5.4: August 7th, 2019 =
* New: Stripe compatibility solution - There is now a setting under `Donations > Settings > Advanced > Stripe` that allows you select which implementation of Stripe you wish to use. If you are using another plugin that uses Stripe to accept payments there is a chance that it may include the [Stripe SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php) (Software Development Kit) either through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) or manually initialized. This can cause conflicts with GiveWP because WordPress does not have a dependency management system to prevent conflicts and the other plugins may be using outdated versions compared to GiveWP's. To help resolve conflicts we have included two options to use Stripe alongside these other plugins. The recommended way is Composer, but if that is not working then we recommend manual initialized. If both options do not work please [contact support](https://givewp.com/support). [#4193](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4193)
* Fix: When using Stripe there was a chance your donors would get a receipt from Stripe and from GiveWP. There is now a setting to set whether you want to send Stripe generated receipt emails or use GiveWP's. We recommend using ours if you're using multiple gateways, but if you're only using Stripe you may enable this new option and disable the default receipts. [#4203](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4203)
* Fix: There was an issue with converting dollars to cents and back within Stripe free which has been resolved and now has unit tests to ensure no more issues crop up with the functional conversions. [#4200](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4220)
* Fix: When editing a donor you can now properly remove the "Title" for the donor (such as "Mr", "Mrs", etc). [#4211](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4211)
* Fix: Ensure the requirement on the state field is removed from hidden state fields for certain countries and regions. [#4201](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4201)
* Fix: Resolved a compatibility issue with the Tickera plugin's implementation of QR codes within the PDF generator. The issue was with our shared library of TCPDF and now the QR codes display correctly due to a constant change on our end. [#3880](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/3880)
* Tweak: You can now activate any plugin under `Settings > Licenses`. Previously we were requiring the author to only be GiveWP which caused an "this plugin does not have a valid header" error message to annoyingly display. [#4217](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4217)

= 2.5.3: July 30th, 2019 =
