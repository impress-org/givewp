=== ‚ú® GiveWP Features ===

GiveWP is free and full of many advanced features to suit your needs. Start by choosing one of our donation form templates to create your first fundraising campaign. Then, take advantage of full-featured fundraising reports and donor management tools to increase your overall fundraising revenue by learning what makes donors donate.

Free donor tools also help keep your donors happy. The donor dashboard helps your donor base easily manage their accounts and access their donation history. With our [premium add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons "See all our Premium Add-ons"), you can add additional donor tools, like annual receipts.

**[Powerful Donation Forms](https://go.givewp.com/features-forms "See how powerful our fundraising forms can be")**

GiveWP has taken inspiration from Gutenberg blocks to create an even better form-building experience. The Visual Donation Form Builder uses sections and blocks to provide a more intuitive way to build and configure your donation forms.

In this builder, you‚Äôll see your design in real time. Watch as your form takes shape as you select custom colors, fields, elements, and more. For those with a flair for customization, you can add Custom CSS directly into the builder.

* Build custom donation forms in your WordPress admin
* Customize donation form templates without any code
* Add goals, multiple giving amounts, custom amounts, terms and conditions and more with just a couple clicks

Never used blocks before? No worries - [we‚Äôve got you covered with our guide](https://go.givewp.com/visual-builder).

**[Actionable Fundraising Reporting](https://go.givewp.com/features-reports "See our gorgeous and helpful reports dashboards")**

* Get a detailed breakdown of your donation activity
* Control your fundraising data with exports and reports
* Filter reports by date, form, and payment method
* Measure performance across multiple campaigns


**[Complete Donor Management](https://go.givewp.com/features-donor-management "See how our donor management tools help you enhance donor loyalty")**

* View a complete history of your donor activity
* Generate tax-deductible receipts
* Allow donors to view their donation history, update their profile, manage their recurring donations, and download PDF receipts through their own donor dashboard

In addition to nonprofit organizations, GiveWP is widely used for individual or creative purposes. We‚Äôve seen tip jars for blogs or musicians, live streams, and more. Our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce Add-on](https://go.givewp.com/wooread) is even used in some eCommerce stores to collect donations for a cause, or ask for tips in the cart or checkout.

We‚Äôve even seen GiveWP used to collect gifts for birthdays and weddings!

=== üíù Simple and Pain-Free Giving ===

We built GiveWP to be the best WordPress donation plugin from day one. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started.

The strength of GiveWP lies within its optimized donation forms. When creating a form, you can start with a template and customize the donation levels, including allowing donors to give a custom amount. The donation forms can then be displayed anywhere on your website using a block, shortcode, widget, or the single donation form page.
You can also integrate your forms with a wide variety of payment processors, including PayPal and Stripe within the free plugin. You can also purchase add-ons to use Authorize,net, Bitpay, Square, and more.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 6.0 or greater
* PHP version 7.2 or greater
* MySQL version 5.7 or greater
* MariaDB version 10 or later
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* cURL version 5.40 or higher
* An SSL certificate -- while this is not strictly required, it is highly recommend. If you are converting your site to use SSL/HTTPS now, [we have a detailed guide to help you here](https://go.givewp.com/ssl).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of GiveWP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "GiveWP" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I learn more about how to use GiveWP? =

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring GiveWP [on our website](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs). We suggest starting with the [GiveWP 101 article](https://go.givewp.com/give-101).

= How can I get support for GiveWP? =

We work hard to the best support possible for GiveWP. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.

[Priority support](https://go.givewp.com/support) is given to users who have an active license for one of GiveWP's [Add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons) or [Pricing Plans](https://go.givewp.com/pricing). We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average 1st response time of 2 to 4 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.

= Do you have any demos? =

Yes! We have several live examples of GiveWP and the wide variety of form options you can use with GiveWP. Check out our [live demo](https://go.givewp.com/demosite), where you can see what your donors would see.

GiveWP Plus, Pro, and Agency Plan customers will also get a free 30-minute website audit with our Customer Success Team after they purchase. In this meeting, we‚Äôll cover everything you need to know about GiveWP to fit your needs.

= Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using GiveWP? =

Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.
"GiveWP Stories" are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented GiveWP with success. [You can read them all here](https://go.givewp.com/stories).
"Case Studies" are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented GiveWP for a specific purpose for an organization. [You can read those here](https://go.givewp.com/case-studies).

= How is GiveWP better than a simple PayPal donate button? =

PayPal donate buttons take your users off-site, which can cause you to lose some in the process. With GiveWP, your donors can stay on-site and you get the benefit of gathering donor data, viewing free fundraising reports, and creating unlimited donation forms. On the other hand, you can always use GiveWP as a simple customized PayPal donate button if you prefer.

= How is GiveWP better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress? =

Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like GiveWP has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a "Donate Now!" button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you'll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins -- but not with GiveWP.

GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They'll work great alongside each other.

= How is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type in their information. You, as the site admin, don‚Äôt want to have to change the word ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù to ‚ÄúDonations‚Äù everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping, either.

On top of that, customizing the plugin‚Äôs terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an ‚Äúinvoice‚Äù for the donation ‚Äúproduct‚Äù they ‚Äúpurchased.‚Äù Rather, you‚Äôd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.

Use GiveWP for donations, and let your WooCommerce or WP eCommerce plugin or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.

Additionally, you can use our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce](https://go.givewp.com/addon-upsells/) GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout.

= How do I eliminated the 2% fee on Stripe donations? =

The 2% fee on Stripe donations only applies to donations taken via our free Stripe integration in GiveWP Core. If you purchase the premium Stripe add-on you will not have any additional fees at all. Additionally, even with the free Stripe plugin, the fees only apply to one-time donations, never to recurring donations.

[Read our release announcement](https://go.givewp.com/version2-5) for all the details, and if you have further questions feel free to reach out via [our contact page](https://go.givewp.com/contact).
