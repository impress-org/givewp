= Who Uses GiveWP? =

With more than 100,000+ active installs of GiveWP, we hear more and more success stories from nonprofit organizations using GiveWP. Causes are using GiveWP to raise millions of dollars per year. Check out some of our [GiveWP Stories](https://go.givewp.com/stories) and [Case Studies](https://go.givewp.com/case-studies) for details about their success.

= Why Use GiveWP for Donations? =

If your nonprofit or cause depends on donations, you want to treat your donors right. Don't send them through a shopping cart or kick them off-site to a third-party platform. GiveWP streamlines the giving process by allowing your donors to complete their donations directly on your website using an easy to complete donation form. As an admin, you have the customization options and reporting and donor management features you need in order to run successful giving campaigns.

You may have struggled with other WordPress donation plugins in the past; dealing with the lack of features, documentation, and support can be a real pain. There's a better way. Now you have GiveWP and our entire team on *your* side.

= Simple and Pain-Free Giving =

Our development and support team built GiveWP from day one with best practices in WordPress development and online giving in mind. GiveWP works great -- the "WordPress way" so you're already familiar with the interface once you begin using it.

The strength of GiveWP lies within its optimized donation forms. When creating a form you may specify whether the form is a single or multi-level amounts. As well, you can allow donors to give a custom amount if you wish. The donation forms can then be displayed anywhere on your website using a shortcode, widget, or the single donation form page. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started.

= First Time Users =

For new users, we suggest reviewing our [Getting Started Guide](https://go.givewp.com/rmgettingstarted "Visit the GiveWP Getting Started Guide") to get an understanding of how the plugin works. If you run into any trouble, we offer [free support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give "Visit the GiveWP support page on WordPress.org") to help you with your issues, questions, and concerns.

= Accept Credit Card Donations =

GiveWP comes with several payment gateway options:

* **Works with Stripe** -- Our Stripe integration allows you to accept credit card donations on your website. There is a small 2% fee associated with these donations. Want no additional fees? Upgrade to our [Stripe Premium add-on](https://go.givewp.com/addon-stripe).
* **PayPal Donations** -- Allow worldwide donations with PayPal Donations. No additional fees applied.
* **Offline Donations** -- Enable your donors to send checks or physical donations with an offline gateway with instructions.
* **Test Gateway** -- use the Test Gateway to see exactly how your donors will walk through the donation process.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* cURL version 5.40 or higher
* An SSL certificate -- while this is not strictly required, it is highly recommend. If you are converting your site to use SSL/HTTPS now, [we have a detailed guide to help you here](https://go.givewp.com/ssl).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of GiveWP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "GiveWP" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I learn more about how to use GiveWP? =

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring GiveWP [on our website](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs). We suggest starting with the [GiveWP 101 article](https://go.givewp.com/give-101).

= How can I get support for GiveWP? =

We work hard to the best support possible for GiveWP. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.

[Priority support](https://go.givewp.com/support) is given to users who have an active license for one of GiveWP's [Add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons) or [Pricing Plans](https://go.givewp.com/pricing). We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average 1st response time of 2 to 4 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.

= Do you have any demos? =

Yes! We have several live examples of GiveWP and the wide variety of form options you can use with GiveWP. Check out [our Demos here](https://go.givewp.com/demos).

= Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using GiveWP? =

Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.
"GiveWP Stories" are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented GiveWP with success. [You can read them all here](https://go.givewp.com/stories).
"Case Studies" are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented GiveWP for a specific purpose for an organization. [You can read those here](https://go.givewp.com/case-studies).

= How is GiveWP better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress? =

Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like GiveWP has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a "Donate Now!" button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you'll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins -- but not with GiveWP.

GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They'll work great alongside each other.

= How is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We actually built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type their information in. You, as the site admin, don't want to have to change the word "Products" to "Donations" everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping either.

On top of that, customizing the plugin's terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an "invoice" for the donation "product" they "purchased". Rather, you'd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.

Use GiveWP for donations, and let yourWooCommerce or WP eCommerce pluginor the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.

Additionally, you can use our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce](https://go.givewp.com/addon-upsells/) GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout as well.

= How do I eliminated the 2% fee on Stripe donations? =

The 2% fee on Stripe donations only applies to donations taken via our free Stripe integration in GiveWP Core. If you purchase the premium Stripe add-on you will not have any additional fees at all. Additionally, even with the free Stripe plugin, the fees only apply to one-time donations, never to recurring donations.

[Read our release announcement](https://go.givewp.com/version2-5) for all the details, and if you have further questions feel free to reach out via [our contact page](https://go.givewp.com/contact).

= 2.5.12: December 31st, 2019 =
* Fix: Resolved an issue with donation receipt emails and admin notifications not being sent out properly when a new donation is made. The cause of the issue was a security permission check incorrectly put in place in the previous version that was unable to be bypassed by new donors.

= 2.5.4: August 7th, 2019 =
* New: Stripe compatibility solution - There is now a setting under `Donations > Settings > Advanced > Stripe` that allows you select which implementation of Stripe you wish to use. If you are using another plugin that uses Stripe to accept payments there is a chance that it may include the [Stripe SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php) (Software Development Kit) either through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) or manually initialized. This can cause conflicts with GiveWP because WordPress does not have a dependency management system to prevent conflicts and the other plugins may be using outdated versions compared to GiveWP's. To help resolve conflicts we have included two options to use Stripe alongside these other plugins. The recommended way is Composer, but if that is not working then we recommend manual initialized. If both options do not work please [contact support](https://givewp.com/support). [#4193](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4193)
* Fix: When using Stripe there was a chance your donors would get a receipt from Stripe and from GiveWP. There is now a setting to set whether you want to send Stripe generated receipt emails or use GiveWP's. We recommend using ours if you're using multiple gateways, but if you're only using Stripe you may enable this new option and disable the default receipts. [#4203](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4203)
* Fix: There was an issue with converting dollars to cents and back within Stripe free which has been resolved and now has unit tests to ensure no more issues crop up with the functional conversions. [#4200](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4220)
* Fix: When editing a donor you can now properly remove the "Title" for the donor (such as "Mr", "Mrs", etc). [#4211](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4211)
* Fix: Ensure the requirement on the state field is removed from hidden state fields for certain countries and regions. [#4201](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4201)
* Fix: Resolved a compatibility issue with the Tickera plugin's implementation of QR codes within the PDF generator. The issue was with our shared library of TCPDF and now the QR codes display correctly due to a constant change on our end. [#3880](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/3880)
* Tweak: You can now activate any plugin under `Settings > Licenses`. Previously we were requiring the author to only be GiveWP which caused an "this plugin does not have a valid header" error message to annoyingly display. [#4217](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4217)

= 2.5.3: July 30th, 2019 =

* Fix: Resolved an issue with editing a donation form when it has thousands of donations. To prevent this issue we now are deleting the group cache of the donation and donor instead of individual IDs.
* Fix: Several deprecation notices were displaying for our Gutenberg Blocks. They are now all updated with the latest version of the WP Block Editor. [#4137](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4137)

= 2.2.0: July 30th, 2018 =
* Important: This release requires a number of updates to our add-ons for full compatibility due to the optimization of how we handle donor session data and additional refactoring of the database schema.

* New: You can now enable Title Prefixes, or also commonly called "Honorifics" (Mr., Mrs., Dr.), for donors in a flexible and customizable way. [#3011](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/3011)
* New: Refactored how GiveWP stores sessions in a much more cache-friendly way using a new custom table called "_give_sessions". For more information please see the [this GiveWP developers post](https://developers.givewp.com/2018/07/24/give-2-2-0-revamp-session/) for more information.

* Tweak: Improved the database update process so that even if AJAX is inaccessible by the plugin updates can still be ran. The only difference is that admins will have to remain on the page while the upgrade runs. AJAX was used for background updates, but if it's not able to be used the background process is removed and a notice displays prompting the admin to remain on page.

= 2.0.0: January 17th, 2018  =
* New: We have refactored how GiveWP stores data so it's much more scalable now. This means implementing custom tables and our own database schema. We've worked hard to ensure the upgrade routine works without an issue but be sure to make a backup just in case. [How to Prepare Your WordPress Site for GiveWP 2.0](https://givewp.com/prepare-for-give-2-0/), [#1132](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1132), [#1148](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1148)

* New: Revamped how donors can create an account when giving. Rather than adding additional form fields there's now a single "Create an account" checkbox. If checked upon submission of the donation a new WP User will be automatically created for that donor. [#1517](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1517)
* New: Implementing query caching in wp-admin for intense queries. You should see improved load times now when viewing your donations, donors, reports and more. [#1944](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1944), [#2121](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/2121)
