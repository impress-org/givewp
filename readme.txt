= Why Use Give for Donations? =

Prior to Give there was no single goto solution for accepting donations on WordPress. *Sure*, Gravity Forms and WooCommerce are great plugins... but they're not developed to work specifically for accepting donations. This can often lead to your users being confused by unnecessary cart systems, incorrect terminology, and clunky user experiences. As an admin, you may have experience wrestling with the various other WordPress donation plugins. Dealing with the lack of features, documentation, and support can be a real pain. There's a better way. Now you have Give and the entire team on *your* side.

= Simple and Pain Free Giving =

Give works great right in WordPress in a way that you're already familiar in working. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started. The backbone of Give lies within its forms. Forms are what allow you to accept donations anywhere on your website. When creating a form you may specify whether the form is a single or multi-level amount. As well, forms can accept a user provided donation amount.

= First Time Users =

For new users, we suggest reviewing our [documentation](https://givewp.com/documentation "Visit the Give docs") to get an understanding of how the plugin works prior to using it. If you run into any trouble, we offer [free support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give "Visit the Give support page on WordPress.org") to help you with your issues, questions, and concerns.

= Zero Commission Charges =

We earn money by selling [premium add-ons](https://givewp.com/addons/ "View all of Give's Premium Add-ons"). The money you raise using Give is yours to support your cause. Period. Add-ons are premium features that enable you to extend the functionality of Give. For example, you can use one of our add-ons to accept funds through your favorite payment gateway or send new donor emails to MailChimp. [View all of Give's Add-ons](https://givewp.com/addons "View all Give add-ons") to discover all the ways you can extend Give.

= Easy to Customize and Enhance =

Give is built by [WordImpress](http://wordimpress.com "Visit the the developers of Give - WordImpress"), our plugins are built from the ground up to be intuitive and easy to use. By following along with our [Getting Stated Guide](https://givewp.com/documentation/core/give-101/ "Give 101 - Getting started using Give to accept donations on WordPress"), setting up Give to accept donations on WordPress is simple and easy.

Do you have some development experience? We've built in an advanced templating system similar to the ones found in many of WordPress' top plugins that makes customizing many of Give's frontend elements upgrade proof and extremely flexible. Run into some trouble? We're here to help! Along with the plugin is a support team that is dedicated, fast to respond, and always willing to squash bugs and help troubleshoot.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Give, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Give" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I learn more about how to use Give? =

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring Give [on our website](https://givewp.com/documentation/). We suggest starting with the [Give 101 article](https://givewp.com/documentation/core/give-101/).

= How can I get support for Give? =

We work hard to the best support possible for Give. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to provide ensure everyone gets an answer. [Priority support](https://givewp.com/support/) is given to users who have an active license for one of Give's [Add-ons](https://givewp.com/addons/) or [Bundles](https://givewp.com/addon-bundles/). This is email based support

= Do you have any demos? =

Yes! We have several live examples of Give displaying usage with many [popular WordPress Themes here](https://givewp.com/demos/).

= Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using Give? =

Yes! We call them "Give Stories". [You can read them all here](https://givewp.com/give-stories/).

= How is Give better than *Gravity Forms* for accepting donations through WordPress? =

First off, we love Gravity Forms. It's a great plugin and has a lot of good features for accepting donations. That being said, it lacks substantial donation reporting features and requires a developer license ($199/yr) to accept credit card payments on site.

= How is Give better than *WooCommerce* for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We also really like WooCommerce. It's hands-down the most robust eCommerce platform for WordPress. But that's also the issue. Typically you don't need a cart system, shipping, or tax calculations to accept donations. On top of that, customizing the plugin's terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an "invoice" for the donation "product" they "purchased". Rather, you'd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave. WooCommerce can do donations, but that's not what it was designed for.

== Screenshots ==

1. Creating powerful donation forms is easy with Give. Simply install the plugin, create a new donation form, set the desired giving options, and publish!

2. Donation form fields can appear within a modal window (as shown here), be revealed with a nice sliding animation, or display entirely on the page (default).

3. Give makes the donation process simple and easy for your donors. This helps maximize conversion rates and further empower your cause.

4. The multi-level donation amount functionality allows you to set different giving levels for your donors to choose from. In addition, you can allow donors to specify custom donation amounts and even set donation goals.

5. The admin view of a donation form with multi-level amounts configured. Give's flexible options allow you to control whether the amounts output as radio buttons, a select field, or input buttons.

6. Don't need donation levels? No problem. You can set a default amount and allow your donor's to configure a custom donation amount to create a simple, yet powerful, donation form.

7. In-depth donation reports allow you to track just how much your cause has raised over time. You can even export the data to CSV or PDF formats.

8. Extend Give with a robust suite of powerful [Add-ons](https://givewp.com/addons "View all Give Add-ons"). Accept recurring donations, credit cards, add custom form fields, and more!

9. Give is thoroughly [documented](https://givewp.com/documentation "Visit the Give documentation") to help you get started quickly and learn basic to advanced features and functionalities.

10. Give has a dedicated support team to help answer any questions you may have and help you through stumbling blocks.

11. We are proud to build Give in collaboration with many of the WordPress communities' top developers.
