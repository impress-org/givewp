# How To Contribute

Community made patches, localizations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and crucial to ensure Give remains the leading donation plugin for WordPress.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below to help us keep on top of things.

__Please Note:__

GitHub is for _bug reports and contributions only_ - if you have a support question or a request for a customization this is not the right place to post it. Use [Give Support](https://givewp.com/support/) for customer support, [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) for community support.

## Contributing To The Core

### Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. In fact you don't even need to know a programming language or to be able to check the code itself, you just need to make sure that everything works as expected and [submit an issue report](https://github.com/impress-org/give/issues/new) if you spot a bug. Sound like something you're up for? Go for it!

#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help us fix it by submitting an issue report:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/impress-org/give/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there
* Submit a report for your issue
  * Clearly describe the issue (including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug)
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

### Making Changes

Making changes to the core is a key way to help us improve Give. You will need some technical skills to make a change, like knowing a bit of PHP, CSS, SASS or JavaScript.

If you think something could be improved and you're able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request. We'll be pleased to get it :)

#### How To Submit A PR

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
  * Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).
* When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the applicable branch of the Give repository. 
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by the Give developers.
* Please **don't** add your localizations or update the .pot files - these will also be maintained by the Give developers. To contribute to the localization of Give, please join the [translate.wordpress.org project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/give). This is much needed, if you speak a language that needs translating consider yourself officially invited to the party.

After you follow the step above, the next stage will be waiting on us to merge your Pull Request. We review them all, and make suggestions and changes as and if necessary.

## Contribute To Localizing Give

Localization is a very important part of Give. We believe in internationalization and want our platform to be available to everyone, everywhere with equal ease. When you localize Give, you are helping hundreds of people in the world, and all the people who speak your language. That's pretty neat.

### Translating Give Core

We have a [project on translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/Give). You can join the localization team of your language and help by translating Give. [Find more about using joining a language team and using GlotPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

If Give is already 100% translated for your language, join the team anyway! We regularly update our language files and there will definitely be need of your help soon.
