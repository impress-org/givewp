            # This was a total pain to get setup. The default authentication plugin changed in MySQL 8 and is incompatible
            # with WordPress. So it needs to be set back to mysql_native_password. The best way to do this is to use the
            # command option in docker to apply it once the container is set up... but Github Actions does not support this.
            # The workaround is to execute the command in the options, but it is VITAL that it is the LAST option and that any
            # environment variables are added via options. DO NOT ADD THE ENV LINE IN YAML. You've been warned.
