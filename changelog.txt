= 2.5.12: December 31st, 2019 =
* Fix: Resolved an issue with donation receipt emails and admin notifications not being sent out properly when a new donation is made. The cause of the issue was a security permission check incorrectly put in place in the previous version that was unable to be bypassed by new donors. We've reverted that change and fully tested to ensure emails are working as expected again. [#4379](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4379)

= 2.5.11: December 23rd, 2019 =
* Fix: Activating Give created a minor style conflict with the Gutenberg editor slightly pushing down some buttons. This has been resolved by refactoring the styles so they no longer conflict with WP Core elements. [#4354](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4354)
* Fix: Sorting donation payments by taxonomy would result in AJAX fails in JavaScript. [#2976](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/2976)

* Fix: Improved responsiveness in the donation forms list screen by preventing the copy shortcode button from overlapping with other columns on smaller screens. [#4090](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4090)
* Fix: Ensure that empty donation receipt emails can not triggered incorrectly. [#4185](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4185)

* Fix: Improved `give_send_back_to_checkout()` redirect functionality with `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` for a dramatically simpler solution that provides for WordPress installed in a subdirectory. Thanks @luizbills for the contribution! [#4311](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4311)
* Fix: Resolved several style issues with WordPress 5.3+'s new admin changes. [#4315](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4315)

* Fix: Resolve updates not showing up without a manual refresh of licenses. Previously add-on updates would be checked every few weeks. Now they are checked on every 48 hours. [#4318](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4318)
* Fix: Resolved an error with Stripe that would occur if an existing donor would make a new donation using a different credit card. The error "The customer does not have a payment method with the ID..." will no longer appear now and donations will process as expected. [#4328](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4328)
* Fix: Resolved an issue with Stripe Checkout if you chose to load scripts in the footer would result in a redirect loop depending on your set up. [#4329](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4329)
* Fix: When clicking on the modal popup button it would previously be hidden from the DOM which could result in background jumpiness. Now the button is not hidden which leads to better theme compatibility. [#4352](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4352)
* Fix: Corrected an broken URL in the in add-ons header. [#4307](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4307)

[#4280](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4280)
* Fix: The Stripe 2% application fee is not ever charged with the new Checkout 2.0 if you are using the Premium gateway add-on. [#4287](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4287)

* Notice: Please update the Recurring Donations add-on to version `1.9.4+` in order to use GiveWP 2.5.5+.
* Fix: Resolved a fatal error occurring if using an outdated version of the Recurring Donations add-on. The plugin will now display a message and deactivate the add-on to prevent the error. If you are experiencing this issue please rollback GiveWP to 2.5.4 or below using the [WP Rollback](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rollback/) plugin and [contact support](https://givewp.com/support/) for prompt assistance. [#4255](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/pull/4255)

= 2.5.5: September 19th, 2019 =

* Fix: Resolved a security issue responsibly disclosed to use by the good folks at [Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/). Thanks y'all!

= 2.5.4: August 7th, 2019 =
* New: Stripe compatibility solution - There is now a setting under `Donations > Settings > Advanced > Stripe` that allows you select which implementation of Stripe you wish to use. If you are using another plugin that uses Stripe to accept payments there is a chance that it may include the [Stripe SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php) (Software Development Kit) either through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) or manually initialized. This can cause conflicts with GiveWP because WordPress does not have a dependency management system to prevent conflicts and the other plugins may be using outdated versions compared to GiveWP's. To help resolve conflicts we have included two options to use Stripe alongside these other plugins. The recommended way is Composer, but if that is not working then we recommend manual initialized. If both options do not work please [contact support](https://givewp.com/support). [#4193](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4193)
* Fix: When using Stripe there was a chance your donors would get a receipt from Stripe and from GiveWP. There is now a setting to set whether you want to send Stripe generated receipt emails or use GiveWP's. We recommend using ours if you're using multiple gateways, but if you're only using Stripe you may enable this new option and disable the default receipts. [#4203](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4203)
* Fix: There was an issue with converting dollars to cents and back within Stripe free which has been resolved and now has unit tests to ensure no more issues crop up with the functional conversions. [#4200](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4220)
* Fix: When editing a donor you can now properly remove the "Title" for the donor (such as "Mr", "Mrs", etc). [#4211](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4211)
* Fix: Ensure the requirement on the state field is removed from hidden state fields for certain countries and regions. [#4201](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4201)
* Fix: Resolved a compatibility issue with the Tickera plugin's implementation of QR codes within the PDF generator. The issue was with our shared library of TCPDF and now the QR codes display correctly due to a constant change on our end. [#3880](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/3880)
* Tweak: You can now activate any plugin under `Settings > Licenses`. Previously we were requiring the author to only be GiveWP which caused an "this plugin does not have a valid header" error message to annoyingly display. [#4217](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4217)

= 2.5.3: July 30th, 2019 =
* Fix: The Gutenberg Block for Donation Forms embedding was only displaying the most recent 10 donation forms. Now you can search for additional forms and they will for embedding. [#4137](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4137)
* Fix: iThemes Sync was again having an issue with our plugin due to a change we reverted in a previous version. That change has been resolved and now syncing can commence again. Rejoice! [#4195](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4195)
* Fix: Resolved compatibility issues with other plugins using the Stripe SDK by initializing it manually within the included GiveWP Core Stripe gateway class.

* Fix: Resolved an issue with editing a donation form when it has thousands of donations. To prevent this issue we now are deleting the group cache of the donation and donor instead of individual IDs.
* Fix: Several deprecation notices were displaying for our Gutenberg Blocks. They are now all updated with the latest version of the WP Block Editor. [#4137](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4137)

* Fix: Resolve SQL injection vulnerability discovered by Tin Duong from Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs. [Read more](https://fortiguard.com/zeroday/FG-VD-19-098) about the patch and the disclosure. Thanks Tin for responsibly disclosing
