= 2.5.12: December 31st, 2019 =
* Fix: Resolved an issue with donation receipt emails and admin notifications not being sent out properly when a new donation is made. The cause of the issue was a security permission check incorrectly put in place in the previous version that was unable to be bypassed by new donors. We've reverted that change and fully tested to ensure emails are working as expected again. [#4379](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4379)

= 2.5.11: December 23rd, 2019 =

* Fix: Resolved several style issues with WordPress 5.3+'s new admin changes. [#4315](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4315)

If you are experiencing this issue please rollback GiveWP to 2.5.4 or below using the [WP Rollback](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rollback/) plugin and [contact support](https://givewp.com/support/) for prompt assistance. [#4255](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/pull/4255)

* Fix: Resolved a security issue responsibly disclosed to use by the good folks at [Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/). Thanks y'all!

= 2.5.4: August 7th, 2019 =
* New: Stripe compatibility solution - There is now a setting under `Donations > Settings > Advanced > Stripe` that allows you select which implementation of Stripe you wish to use. If you are using another plugin that uses Stripe to accept payments there is a chance that it may include the [Stripe SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php) (Software Development Kit) either through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) or manually initialized. This can cause conflicts with GiveWP because WordPress does not have a dependency management system to prevent conflicts and the other plugins may be using outdated versions compared to GiveWP's. To help resolve conflicts we have included two options to use Stripe alongside these other plugins. The recommended way is Composer, but if that is not working then we recommend manual initialized. If both options do not work please [contact support](https://givewp.com/support). [#4193](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4193)
* Fix: When using Stripe there was a chance your donors would get a receipt from Stripe and from GiveWP. There is now a setting to set whether you want to send Stripe generated receipt emails or use GiveWP's. We recommend using ours if you're using multiple gateways, but if you're only using Stripe you may enable this new option and disable the default receipts. [#4203](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4203)
* Fix: There was an issue with converting dollars to cents and back within Stripe free which has been resolved and now has unit tests to ensure no more issues crop up with the functional conversions. [#4200](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4220)
* Fix: When editing a donor you can now properly remove the "Title" for the donor (such as "Mr", "Mrs", etc). [#4211](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4211)
* Fix: Ensure the requirement on the state field is removed from hidden state fields for certain countries and regions. [#4201](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4201)
* Fix: Resolved a compatibility issue with the Tickera plugin's implementation of QR codes within the PDF generator. The issue was with our shared library of TCPDF and now the QR codes display correctly due to a constant change on our end. [#3880](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/3880)
* Tweak: You can now activate any plugin under `Settings > Licenses`. Previously we were requiring the author to only be GiveWP which caused an "this plugin does not have a valid header" error message to annoyingly display. [#4217](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4217)

= 2.5.3: July 30th, 2019 =
* Fix: The Gutenberg Block for Donation Forms embedding was only displaying the most recent 10 donation forms. Now you can search for additional forms and they will for embedding. [#4137](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4137)

* Fix: Resolved compatibility issues with other plugins using the Stripe SDK by initializing it manually within the included GiveWP Core Stripe gateway class.

* Fix: Resolved an issue with editing a donation form when it has thousands of donations. To prevent this issue we now are deleting the group cache of the donation and donor instead of individual IDs.
* Fix: Several deprecation notices were displaying for our Gutenberg Blocks. They are now all updated with the latest version of the WP Block Editor. [#4137](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/4137)

* Fix: Resolve SQL injection vulnerability discovered by Tin Duong from Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs. [Read more](https://fortiguard.com/zeroday/FG-VD-19-098) about the patch and the disclosure. Thanks Tin for responsibly disclosing

= 2.0.0: January 17th, 2018  =
* New: We have refactored how GiveWP stores data so it's much more scalable now. This means implementing custom tables and our own database schema. We've worked hard to ensure the upgrade routine works without an issue but be sure to make a backup just in case. [How to Prepare Your WordPress Site for GiveWP 2.0](https://givewp.com/prepare-for-give-2-0/), [#1132](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1132), [#1148](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1148)

* New: You can now set donation goals based on total number of donations. For instance, setting a goal to accept 500 total donations is now possible. This is useful if you don't want to show amount or percentage based goals. [#1443](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/issues/1443)
* New: Revamped how donors can create an account when giving. Rather than adding additional form fields there's now a single "Create an account" checkbox.
